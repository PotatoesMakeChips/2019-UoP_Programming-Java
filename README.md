# 2019 UoP Programming - Java
#### Final Coursework Summation for Java Module
This was my final coursework submission for the University of Portsmouth java programming module in 2019. This program is a basic simulation of a smart home, including polymorphism, inheritance and encapsulation.

## Standards used in this project

### Locations
there are three packages in this project:

`smartdevice`
- contains all of the code relevant to the core functionality

`customdata`
- contains all of the code relevant to any custom data types used

`testing`
- contains all of the classes named following the steps in the CW

### Error Checking
When a class that's calling another needs to know the result of an error check
- the integer 1 will be returned in the event of an error
- the integer 0 will be returned if the code does not error 

## Running the program
This program was built to work on java 7 although it's basic enough that it'll probably run on anything newer. The compiled class files are included in the bin directory although I doubt they run anymore
